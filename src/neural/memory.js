/**
 * Mushroom-body learning, on the measured wiring.
 *
 * This is how a fly actually learns what something is worth. Kenyon cells
 * (KCs) carry a sparse code for the current context — here, sitting in front
 * of this machine — and synapse onto the mushroom-body output neurons (MBONs).
 * Each MBON lives in a compartment that one dopamine cluster innervates, and
 * when dopamine arrives while the KCs are active, the KC→MBON synapses in that
 * compartment are DEPRESSED (Hige et al. 2015; Cohn et al. 2015).
 *
 * Which way that pushes behaviour depends on the compartment (Aso et al. 2014):
 *
 *   PAM compartments (reward)       — their MBONs drive AVOIDANCE. Reward
 *                                     weakens them, so the context becomes
 *                                     something to approach.
 *   PPL1 compartments (punishment)  — their MBONs drive APPROACH. Punishment
 *                                     weakens them, so the context becomes
 *                                     something to avoid.
 *
 * Nothing here says which MBON is which. The pairing is read off the
 * connectome: each MBON type's dopaminergic input is counted, and in MaleCNS
 * nearly every one gets it almost entirely from PAM or almost entirely from
 * PPL1 — MBON01 (γ5β'2a) 290 PAM synapses to 1 from PPL1, MBON11 (γ1pedc)
 * 308 from PPL1. That split IS the valence.
 *
 * The rule, per KC→MBON edge, with s the synapse's strength relative to naive:
 *
 *     ds/dt = −η · kc · da · s  +  (1 − s) / τ
 *
 * kc the Kenyon cell type's rate, da the PHASIC dopamine arriving in that
 * MBON's compartment: the burst on top of its own recent level. Plasticity
 * follows dopamine bursts, not the tonic background, so the fly learns from
 * what happens to it rather than from sitting there. The second term is
 * forgetting — slow, minutes, so a memory lasts the session but is not
 * permanent. The weakened synapses are
 * written straight back into the simulation, so the network's own MBON output,
 * and everything downstream of it, changes with what the fly has learned.
