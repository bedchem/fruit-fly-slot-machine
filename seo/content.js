export const FAQ = [
  {
    q: 'Is the fruit fly brain in the Fruit Fly Slot Machine real?',
    a: 'Yes. The anatomy is real: 60,000 neurons are drawn at their measured positions from MaleCNS v1.0, '
      + 'the complete connectome of a male fruit fly mapped by HHMI Janelia\'s FlyEM team with Google Research, '
      + 'the University of Cambridge and the MRC LMB. The wiring the simulation runs on comes from 151.9 million '
      + 'measured synapses. The activity itself is a model, because no one has recorded a fly playing a slot machine.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is a connectome?',
    a: 'A connectome is a complete wiring diagram of a nervous system: every neuron and every synapse between them. '
      + 'The fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster) is the most complex animal whose whole central nervous system has been mapped.',
  },
  {
    q: 'How does the fly decide how much to bet?',
    a: 'Nothing hard-codes the stake. It comes from the fly\'s state at the moment it pulls: low neuropeptide F pushes it '
      + 'to chase losses, recent reward dopamine makes it bolder, the defensive state makes it careful, and what its '
      + 'mushroom body has learned about the machine pushes either way. It bets between 1 and 5 credits.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Does the fruit fly actually learn?',
    a: 'Yes. Its mushroom body learns on the measured wiring: dopamine arriving while Kenyon cells are active weakens '
      + 'the Kenyon cell to MBON synapses in that compartment. Punishment (PPL1) weakens the MBONs that drive approach, '
      + 'reward (PAM) weakens the ones that drive avoidance. On these odds it learns the machine is bad, and keeps playing.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What happens when the fly runs out of credit?',
    a: 'It panics, then gives up: its heart slows almost to a stop, its satisfaction signal drains and it slumps on the '
      + 'stool, behaving as if it were dying. After a while someone feeds the machine and it comes round, warier than before.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Is this a gambling website?',
    a: 'No. There is no money, no betting and nothing to buy. The fly plays alone; you watch.',
  },
  {
    q: 'What is the Fruit Fly Slot Machine built with?',
    a: 'React, three.js and React Three Fiber in the browser. The connectome simulation, the mushroom-body learning and '
      + 'the synthesised sound all run client-side in JavaScript, with no server and no tracking.',
  },
  {
    q: 'Who made the Fruit Fly Slot Machine?',
    a: 'It was made by ryhox, Nexor and peramanu. The source code is open on GitHub.',
  },
